Changes
=======

1.1.0 (2015-11-12)
-----------
- (Feature) OPAL now saves a vector to the workspace of those municipalities 
  (softboundary 3) that intersect the project footprint.  This is only saved
  when the softboundary 3 input is provided by the user.
- (Bugfix) Corrected an issue where testing future scenarios in the static map 
  generator would raise an exception.
- (Usability) Versioning replaced by `natcap.versioner`
- (Usability) OPAL UI is now offered in spanish as well as english.
- (Usability) OPAL UI allows for the user to select their language of choice among 
  those offered (currently english and spanish).
- (Feature) OPAL/MAFE-T report and output CSV values are rounded to 3 significant 
  figures.
- (Bufgix) Improved sorting by checkboxes in output report.
- (Usability) Improved logging to user within longer-running processes.
- (Feature) User's guide is tracked as a subrepository along with each build of
  OPAL.  User's guide version numbers are pulled from the OPAL source tree.
- (Feature) OPAL/MAFE-T report now includes the OPAL version used and a 
  time/date stamp.
- (Bugfix) The OPAL/MAFE-T report used to offer a hyperlink to the vector
  (a multi-part ESRI Shapefile) containing the set of parcels matching 
  criteria.  Clicking this link would only download part of the file.
  It has been replaced with a text reference to the location of the file on 
  disk.
- (Usability) Select all/Select None buttons have been removed from the report.
  They didn't work.  They will be added back when they work properly.
- (Usability) Files within the workspace that are outside of the per-hydrozone
  analysis are now hidden within an intermediate/ folder.
- (Usability) Various files have been renamed.
- (Bugfix) The headers of the top table of the output report now render in the
  language of the OPAL run.  They used to always render in english.
- (Bugfix) Parcels in the parcels table of the report are now correctly screened
  to ensure that they are at least as large as the smallest impacted area
  of the same ecosystem type.
- (Usability) The user is now unable to close the OPAL/MAFE-T execution dialog
  unless the model run has completed or the process is terminated externally.
- (Bugfix) Better handling for when the user provides an ecosystem vector without
  any features or when the vector is of the wrong type (points or lines instead
  of polygons).
- (Usability) When a validated, optional input has its value removed from a UI
  input, the green checkbox indicating input validity is now disabled.
- (Bugfix) OPAL UI now allows files containing any UTF-8 character to be selected
  by the user.
- (Feature) Output vector of selected offsets now includes the distance from the 
  nearest impact site and the parcel size in the attribute table.
- (Bugfix) Output report had some columns that were incorrectly rounded to 1 
  decimal place instead of 2.
- (Usability) OPAL/MAFE-T will now confirm that the user wishes to overwrite the
  workspace if files exist within the user-defined workspace.  This dialog
  is triggered if the user-defined workspace exists and there are files within.
- (Usability) OPAL/MAFE-T will now prompt the user for a language on startup
  and remember the user's selection.  The language may be set at any time
  through File -> Select Language.  Changing the language will trigger an 
  application restart.
